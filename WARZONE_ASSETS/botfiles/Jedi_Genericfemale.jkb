//Some values are base values and changed by the in-game skill. The formula for reflex and accuracy
//is basevalue/skill. So if you give a base reflex of 500ms, a nightmare bot will have a reaction time of
//100ms. Other values, like turnspeed_combat (higher == faster), are multiplied by the skill number.

//Note also that depending on if the bot and the enemy are moving at the same time, the degrees the bot
//aims off by can be greater than the maximum accuracy value. So if the bot and its enemy are both flying
//through the air and accuracy is at 20, the bot could easily aim off by 25 degrees instead. That is,
//unless perfectaim is 1. In this case the bot will aim perfectly at all times (as the name indicates).
