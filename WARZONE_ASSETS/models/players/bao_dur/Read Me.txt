1. What is this?
----------------

This is a reskin for the Party Bao-Dur. Some of the changes have been simple others have been very difficult to get at.




2. What is new?
----------------

- I have removed most of the un-realistic face tattoes that Bao had. This gives him a much more realistic human apperance even though he is an Irodonian or Zabrack as some people like to call him. 

- I have given him a small facelift to give him a better apperance

- I have Changed the darkside transitions. The don't have tattoes either and they have been almost given a new apperance.

- I have softened the skin around the lower face area to give a more natural apperance.

- I have Changed Bao's cloting to a nice green colour. Also i have hidden his small bit of arm showing with his new T-Shirt.

- I have changed the portrait of Bao to match his new look. I'm not the best at reskining so please don't blame me if it is not perfectly accurate.




3. What did you not change?
-----------------------

- I have not changed the little Remote that pesters us soooo much!

- I have not changed the Lower body or clothes (Apart from the T-Shirt).


- I have not changed the model in any way because you do not have any .mdl or .mdx files to put into your Override folder. Changing the model would result in having to do a new texture so i left it as it is.





4. How do I install it?
-----------------------

To install you will need WinRar. You can get it at:

www.rarlab.com

Unpack all the files and extract the following files to:

LocalDisk (C:)>Program Files>Lucasarts>SWKotOR2>Override

"P_Bao_DurA"
"P_Bao_DurAD01"
"P_Bao_DurH"
"P_Bao_DurHD1"
"P_Bao_DurHD2"
"P_BaoDur_Arm"
"PO_PBaoDur"
"PO_PBaoDurd1"
"PO_PBaoDurd2"

Of course it won't hurt to put the screens and read me in the Override folder but it won't do any good either!

Some Novice users in WinRar may want to use the Wizard function. It will Put WinRar in a similar Style to Window's Explorer. You can then copy the files to

LocalDisk (C:)>Program Files>Lucasarts>SWKotOR2>Override



5. How do I use it?
-------------------

This is a reskin you can't USE it! When you meet Bao, he will have his new look!




6. How do I uninstall it?
-------------------------
To uninstall simply remove the following files from the Override folder:

"P_Bao_DurA"
"P_Bao_DurAD01"
"P_Bao_DurH"
"P_Bao_DurHD1"
"P_Bao_DurHD2"
"P_BaoDur_Arm"
"PO_PBaoDur"
"PO_PBaoDurd1"
"PO_PBaoDurd2"


7. Troubleshooting
------------------
Q: Bao-Dur appears see-through!
A: You have the brightness on your screen to high. You van edit that from the options menu or from your screen directly. If you edit the screen options enough it will appear a lot better!

Q: The Skin is not working!
A: There are several reasons for this;

- You may not have installed the files correctly, see section 4 for info

- You may be looking at the wrong texture. He will NOT have it in movies. 

- You may have another mod confilcting with this one! The shock, the horror! If you want either skin to work properley it is best to uninstall one. See Section 5 for Uninstallation instructions.
