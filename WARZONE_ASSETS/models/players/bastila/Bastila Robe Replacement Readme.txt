Description;
This mod replaces the appearance of the Jedi robe son Bastila Shan with reskins I did of her clothing model.  
Theres a version for each color robe, Red, Blue, Black and Brown.


Installation;
Copy and paste all files into your KOTOR override directory.


Compatibility;
If you are already using a mod with an Appearance.2da file do not put mine into your override, theres a very 
simple process to make it compatible.

First open the .2da editor in Fred Tetra's KOTOR Tool. Then go to line 4, which is Bastila's. Scroll to the
right to find the column labeled modeli and replace it with P_BastilaBB. Then in column texi, very next one 
to the right of modeli, change it to W_BasRobe.


Uninstallation;
Remove the files from the Override folder in my mod from yourr KOTOR Oveerride.
