DARTH NIHILUS - LORD OF HUNGER

Author: Drewton
Released: 3/05/09
Game: KOTOR 2 - TSL
Type: Reskin

Description:
I've always liked the design of Darth Nihilus, generally. It's a very simple yet instantly recognizable costume, and perhaps the best of the KOTOR Sith. The concept art had a really great look. However, the final game result was, like Atris, just not as good as that. The mask in particular looked very different. Since then, we've had a Wizards of the Coast image and a Hasbro figure. The mask of the latter of which is much closer to the concept art, and both show Nihilus with what almost looks to be black Jed robes.

This reskin does not completely change the design of Nihilus, but like the Darth Malak - Dark Lord of the Sith, simply improves the idea and makes it look closer to recent images. The mask, robe, and cape have been completely redone, in addition to more overall texture to the robes.

Enjoy!
