/*
  The purpose of G_Alloc is to efficiently allocate memory for objects
  typically when the game is starting up. It shouldn't be used as a general
  purpose allocator that's used when the game is running, and especially not
  from a client command! It is *by design* that memory blocks can't be
  deallocated while the game is running!

  If your mod experiences the allocation failed error often, use g_debugAlloc
  to trace down where G_Alloc is being called and to make sure it isn't used
  often while the game is running. Feel free to increase POOLSIZE for your mod!
